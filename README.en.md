  - Cash: immediate payment of R$ 50.00
  - Card: left as guarantee equivalent to R$ 50.00
  - Promissory note: payment commitment equivalent to R$ 50.00
- **Final Settlement:**
  - Players who paid in cash receive the exact value of final chips
  - If chip value > (cards + promissory notes) × R$ 50.00: player has money to receive
  - If chip value < (cards + promissory notes) × R$ 50.00: player must pay
  - At the end of the game, accounting is generated with payment list between players
